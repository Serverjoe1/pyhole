pyhole is my own clone for my own personal use, but I thought I'd upload it to GitHub in case it's of use to anyone else (particularly the fine folks of the original Pi-Hole project).  It is not a stable project and currently has no focus on backwards compatibility.  Please keep this in mind when submitting issues and pull requests - you may prefer to start your own fork.

Additionally, please adhere to the following:

* Use 4 spaces instead of tabs.  This is very important for a Python project.
* Commit Unix line endings
* Before submitting your pull request, merge with your new branch, fix any conflicts, and make sure nothing breaks.
* Be VERY patient.
